Rent Price Prediction (End-to-End ML + MLOps)

An end-to-end machine learning system for predicting apartment rent prices using structured housing data.
The project demonstrates production-grade ML engineering, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, experiment tracking with MLflow, and reusable inference pipelines.

Problem Statement

Accurately predicting rental prices is challenging due to:
Mixed numerical & categorical features
Location-driven price variation
High variance across property types

This project addresses these challenges using a robust ML pipeline with cross-validated model selection and experiment tracking.

Key Features

End-to-end ML pipeline (not a notebook)
Automated model comparison with cross-validation
Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
Experiment tracking with MLflow
Model versioning & reproducibility
Saved preprocessing + model pipeline
Modular, production-ready codebase
